# Project-2-Brain-tumor-detection
# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using CNN

This project classifies brain tumors into four categories — **glioma**, **meningioma**, **notumor**, and **pituitary** — using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It includes a simple web interface built with **Gradio** to make predictions on uploaded MRI images.
